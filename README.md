# Data Visualization for Billboard's Charts
Graphs a song's chart position from a specified date or longest continuous streak where the song still remains on the chart. Compare what new songs have appeared on this week's chart to a chart from a specified date.  When a specified date is given, the chart closest to that given date will be calculated because charts are updated about every Saturday. The charts are taken from Billboard's [website](http://www.billboard.com/charts). This project uses Flask, Python, BeautifulSoup, JavaScript, d3.js, HTML, and CSS. 

## Improvements:
* Optimize code to scrape data faster especially for the graphs.
* Allow multiple songs to be selected for a multi-line graph.
* Implement a more aesthetically pleasing layout by incorporating Bootstrap.
* Use data from other charts like the New York Times Bestseller Book Lists.
